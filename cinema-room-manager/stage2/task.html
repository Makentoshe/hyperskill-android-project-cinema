<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Good job: our friends really liked your program!&nbsp;Now they want to expand their app by adding
    a wholesome feature, named &quot;profit&quot;. This feature depends on movie duration, ratings,
    and available seats in the cinema room. This feature&nbsp;allows defining the best cinema
    session. Help&nbsp;them calculate the &quot;profit&quot; from the current session, and, maybe,
    let them raise the ticket cost for the best/popular movies.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you need to read two positive numbers from the activity intent property: the movie
    duration in full minutes (under the &quot;DURATION&quot; string key) and the movie rating in the
    range 0 until 5 (under the &quot;RATING&quot; string key). The ticket price is determined by the
    following rules:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The most comfortable movie duration is 90 minutes, so, the formula for predicting profit:&nbsp;<span
            class="math-tex">\[y = -{1 \over 90} x^2 +2x + 90\]</span>where <em>x</em> is a movie
        duration in full minutes, and y is a <em>movie_duration_profit</em></li>
    <li>The base formula for the ticket price is (<em>rating </em><em>*&nbsp;movie_duration_profit)
        / available_seats</em></li>
    <li>If the rating doesn&#39;t declare from intent, the value should be equal to 4.5.</li>
    <li>If the movie duration doesn&#39;t declare from intent, the value should be equal to 108.
    </li>
    <li>The calculation result should look like &quot;Estimated ticket price: your-value-here$&quot;
        and placed in a TextView with id <em>cinema_room_ticket_price</em>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This is how your application may be looked like after stage completion.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>, that the application on the screenshot is in the system dark mode. If you
    prefer a light system mode, your application&nbsp;<em>may&nbsp;</em>use another color scheme.
