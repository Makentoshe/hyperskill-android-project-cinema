<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Running a cinema theatre is no easy business. To help our friends, let's add statistics to your
    program. The stats will show the current income, total income, the number of available seats,
    and the number of occupied seats.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Add a simple layout where the main info about the cinema room will be displayed: </p>

<p><br>
    - TextView with id <code>cinema_room_total_income</code> should have text as an example: "Total
    cinema income: 123.45$"</p>

<p>- TextView with id <code>cinema_room_current_income</code> should have text as an
    example: "Current cinema income: 0.00$"</p>

<p>- TextView with id <code>cinema_room_available_seats</code> should have text as an example:
    "Available seats: 56"</p>

<p>- TextView with id <code>cinema_room_occupied_seats</code> should have text as an example:
    "Occupied seats: 0"</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>This is how your application may be looked like after stage completion.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>, that the application on the screenshot is in the system dark mode. If you
    prefer a light system mode, your application <em>may </em>use another color scheme.</p>
