<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The theatre is getting popular, and the customers started complaining that it's not practical
    that the application doesn't allow buying tickets. Let's add a dialog that will allow them to
    buy tickets and display the current state of the seating arrangement when needed.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Clicking on the seat displays a dialog that contains a ticket price and two options - buy a
    ticket or cancel the purchase. If a ticket was already bought, clicking on that seat should be
    disabled. For a better user experience let's color seats in the cinema room. The available seats
    should be green, and those already purchased should be gray.<br>
    <br>
    1) The AlertDialog title should have a row and a place number. Example template: "Buy a ticket 1
    row 6 place".</p>

<p>2) AlertDialog message should have a ticket price. Example template: "Your ticket price is
    24.11$".</p>

<p>3) AlertDialog should have a positive button with a "Buy a ticket" text.</p>

<p>4) AlertDialog should have a negative button with a "Cancel purchase" text.</p>

<p>5) The purchased place should be disabled for clicking and its
    indicator(R.id.cinema_room_place_indicator) should be a CardView type and have a gray color
    (Color.DKGRAY or android.R.color.darker_gray) background.
    Use <code>setCardBackgroundColor</code> method for setup a proper property that will be checked
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>This is how your application may be looked like after stage completion.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>, that the application on the screenshot is in the system dark mode. If you
    prefer a light system mode, your application <em>may </em>use another color scheme.</p>
