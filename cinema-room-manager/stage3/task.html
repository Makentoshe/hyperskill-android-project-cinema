<h2>Description</h2>

<p>When choosing a ticket you are guided not only by your space preference but also by your
    finances. Let's implement the opportunity to check the ticket price.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>The seat cost also should be volatile in the range from 0.5 for most distant to 1.5 for less
    distant for base ticket cost. The whole seats in the middle row should have base ticket
    cost. The most distant from the screen row should have a 0.5 base ticket cost. The less distant
    from the screen row should have a 1.5 base ticket cost. Other values should be interpolated.</p>

<p>For example, we have 10 rows with a base ticket cost of 10. The most distant row cost is 15 per
    seat and the less distant row cost is 5 per seat. Let's interpolate [5, 15] range between 10
    steps. The result should be [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] because our friends also want
    to have maximum income.</p>

<p>When you click on the seat, the ticket price should be shown in the Toast. </p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>This is how your application may be looked like after stage completion.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>, that the application on the screenshot is in the system dark mode. If you
    prefer a light system mode, your application <em>may </em>use another color scheme.</p>
