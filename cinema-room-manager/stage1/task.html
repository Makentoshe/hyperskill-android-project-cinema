<h2>Description</h2>

<p>There are many enjoyable&nbsp;activities&nbsp;on this funny little planet&nbsp;Earth, and still,
    the happiest, simplest,&nbsp;and most fulfilling one is probably&nbsp;going&nbsp;to the movies.
    Going with friends, going with loved ones, experiencing a whole new adventure from the safety of
    a cinema seat, surrounded by like-minded fellow travelers.</p>

<p>As a beginner developer, you can contribute to creating this wonderful cinema experience. Your
    good friends asked you&nbsp;to help them create an android application for a cinema theatre
    where people can get tickets, reserve seats, and enjoy their movie night.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p> For 100% successful passing this project your should have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Android Studio Arctic Fox 2020.3.1 (possible Beta)</li>
    <li>Java 11.0.6</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>There is not&nbsp;a lot of space in our new cinema theatre, so you need to take into account the
    restrictions on the number of seats. Your friends said that the&nbsp;room would fit 7 rows of 8
    seats. Your task is to help them visualize the seating arrangement by using GridLayout for
    declaring seats and a screen before seats.</p>

<p>For test purposes, your screen view should have a
    <em><strong>cinema_room_screen_text</strong></em>&nbsp;id and contain a &quot;Screen&quot;
    string. Your <code>GridLayout</code>&nbsp; should have a
    <strong><em>cinema_room_places&nbsp;</em></strong>id. Each place should have a <strong><em>cinema_room_place_item_text</em></strong>&nbsp;id
    and contain a &quot;<em>row</em>.<em>seat</em>&quot; string.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This is how your application may be looked like after stage completion.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>, that the application on the screenshot is in the system dark mode. If you
    prefer a light system mode, your application <em>may </em>use another color scheme.</p>
